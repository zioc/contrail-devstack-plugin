# This list could be generated on the fly using the following commmand:

#find $CONTRAIL_DEST -name requirements.txt -exec cat {} \; \
# awk '$1 !~ /^#|^glance|^heat|^keystone|^neutron|^nova/ {print $1}' |  sort -u

# however, as there are some missing or invalid requirements, as well as some
# extra additions, the list is kept up to date here instead for now

#sandesh_common    # stats-daemon requirement doesn't exists
jsonpickle         # required by schema, but not in its requirements.txt
cassandra-driver   # required by analytics-api, but not in its requirements.txt
kafka              # required by analytics-api
contrail-api-cli   # as it's convenient
